Each service provides an input of attributes whose values should be retrieved. But these services do not only limit themselves to input from external systems. The "Ops" service, for example, provides mechanisms to perform arithmetic and parsing operations over values retrieved from other services.

On the following sub-chapters there is a description of each of the currently distributed and available services.
