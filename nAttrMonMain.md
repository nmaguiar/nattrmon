# Introduction #

The Attribute Monitor is a tool to retrieve value attributes, in cycle (monitoring cycle), from different technologies and systems. The retrieved values can be output to text files and/or to a database for analysis and/or other technologies. Since in each cycle, values can be retrieved from multiple sources, similar attributes from different systems can be compared to observe the behavior of a cluster or an end-to-end functionality. The tool is flexible enough to enable the addition of new systems and technologies as input for attribute values and also to add new output functionality.
